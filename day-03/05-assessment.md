### Question 7 (4 points)
What is the purpose of the `serial` field in a Terraform state file?

a) To store the unique identifier for the terraform configuration version
b) To track the incremental version number of state file changes
c) To identify the specific terraform binary version used for deployment
d) To maintain the chronological order of resource creation timestamps

**Answer: b**

### Question 8 (4 points)
Which command would you use to update the state file with the current infrastructure without making changes?

a) `terraform refresh` to synchronize state with actual infrastructure resources
b) `terraform update` to fetch latest resource information from cloud provider
c) `terraform sync` to align state file with current infrastructure configuration
d) `terraform validate` to check state consistency against actual resources

**Answer: a**

### Question 9 (4 points)

## Section B: Short Answer Questions (30 points)

### Question 11 (10 points)
Explain the difference between local and remote state in Terraform. List three advantages of using remote state over local state.

**Sample Answer:**
Local state stores the terraform.tfstate file on the local machine where Terraform is executed, while remote state stores the state file in a remote backend like S3, Azure Storage, or Terraform Cloud.

Three advantages of remote state:
1. **Team Collaboration** - Multiple team members can access and work with the same state file
2. **State Locking** - Prevents concurrent modifications that could corrupt the state file
3. **Security and Encryption** - Remote backends can provide encryption at rest and access controls

### Question 12 (10 points)
Describe the process of importing an existing AWS resource into Terraform state. Include the necessary steps and commands.

**Sample Answer:**
1. **Add resource configuration** to your .tf files matching the existing resource
2. **Run import command**: `terraform import <resource_type>.<resource_name> <resource_id>`
   Example: `terraform import aws_instance.web i-1234567890abcdef0`
3. **Run terraform plan** to see any configuration differences
4. **Update configuration** to match the actual resource attributes
5. **Run terraform plan again** to ensure no changes are needed

### Question 13 (10 points)
What is state drift and how would you detect and resolve it? Provide specific commands.

**Sample Answer:**
State drift occurs when the actual infrastructure differs from what's recorded in the Terraform state file, usually due to manual changes made outside of Terraform.

**Detection:**
- `terraform plan -detailed-exitcode` - Exit code 2 indicates drift
- `terraform plan` - Shows differences between state and actual infrastructure

**Resolution:**
- `terraform apply -refresh-only` - Updates state to match actual infrastructure
- `terraform apply` - Applies configuration to fix infrastructure drift
- Manual correction of infrastructure to match desired state

## Section C: Practical Scenarios (30 points)

### Scenario 1 (15 points)
You're working on a team project and need to set up remote state backend using S3 and DynamoDB. Write the Terraform configuration for:

1. S3 bucket with versioning and encryption enabled (8 points)
2. DynamoDB table for state locking (4 points)
3. Backend configuration block (3 points)

**Sample Answer:**

```hcl
# 1. S3 bucket configuration
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "terraform_state" {
  bucket = "my-terraform-state-bucket"
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket_versioning" "terraform_state" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.terraform_state.id
  versioning_configuration {
    status = "Enabled"
  }
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket_server_side_encryption_configuration" "terraform_state" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.terraform_state.id
  rule {
    apply_server_side_encryption_by_default {
      sse_algorithm = "AES256"
    }
  }
}

# 2. DynamoDB table for locking
resource "aws_dynamodb_table" "terraform_locks" {
  name           = "terraform-state-locks"
  billing_mode   = "PAY_PER_REQUEST"
  hash_key       = "LockID"

  attribute {
    name = "LockID"
    type = "S"
  }
}

# 3. Backend configuration
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "my-terraform-state-bucket"
    key            = "terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "us-west-2"
    encrypt        = true
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-state-locks"
  }
}
```

### Scenario 2 (15 points)
Your team member accidentally deleted a critical resource from the Terraform state file, but the actual AWS resource still exists. The resource is an EC2 instance with ID `i-0abcd1234efgh5678`. 

Provide the step-by-step commands to:
1. Add the resource back to the configuration (5 points)
2. Import the existing resource (5 points)
3. Verify the import was successful (5 points)

**Sample Answer:**

```bash
# 1. Add resource configuration to main.tf
cat >> main.tf << EOF
resource "aws_instance" "recovered" {
  ami           = "ami-12345678"  # Use actual AMI ID
  instance_type = "t2.micro"     # Use actual instance type
  
  tags = {
    Name = "Recovered Instance"
  }
}
EOF

# 2. Import the existing resource
terraform import aws_instance.recovered i-0abcd1234efgh5678

# 3. Verify the import was successful
terraform state list | grep aws_instance.recovered
terraform state show aws_instance.recovered
terraform plan  # Should show no changes if configuration matches
```

## Section D: Troubleshooting (Bonus - 10 points)

### Bonus Question (10 points)
You encounter the following error when running `terraform plan`:

```
Error: Error acquiring the state lock

Error message: ConditionalCheckFailedException: The conditional request failed
Lock Info:
  ID:        12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012
  Path:      my-bucket/terraform.tfstate
  Operation: OperationTypePlan
  Who:       user@example.com
  Version:   1.6.0
  Created:   2024-01-15 10:30:00 UTC
  Info:      
```

Explain what this error means and provide the commands to resolve it safely.

**Sample Answer:**

This error indicates that the Terraform state is locked by another operation. The lock prevents concurrent modifications that could corrupt the state file.

**What it means:**
- Another Terraform operation is currently running or was interrupted
- The lock is held by user@example.com since 10:30:00 UTC
- Lock ID is 12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012

**Safe resolution steps:**

1. **First, verify no one is actually running Terraform:**
   ```bash
   # Check with team members if anyone is running Terraform
   # Wait a reasonable time for the operation to complete
   ```

2. **Check the lock age:**
   ```bash
   # If the lock is old (hours/days), it's likely stuck
   aws dynamodb scan --table-name terraform-state-locks
   ```

3. **Force unlock (only if certain no operation is running):**
   ```bash
   terraform force-unlock 12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012
   ```

4. **Verify unlock and retry:**
   ```bash
   terraform plan  # Should work now
   ```
