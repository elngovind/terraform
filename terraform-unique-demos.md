# Unique Terraform Day 01 Demo Ideas
## Interactive & Memorable Presentations

---

## **Demo 1: "Infrastructure Horror Story" Interactive Timeline**
**Time: During Manual Deployment Challenges (Slide 2)**

### Setup
Create a live "disaster timeline" on screen where audience shares their worst infrastructure experiences.

### Execution
1. **Start with a blank timeline**
2. **Ask audience:** "What's your worst infrastructure disaster?"
3. **Plot responses** on timeline with impact scale (1-10)
4. **Common themes emerge:** Human error, no rollback, environment drift
5. **Reveal:** "This is why we need IaC!"

### Visual Impact
```
2019: "Deleted production DB" (Impact: 10)
2020: "Config drift broke staging" (Impact: 7)
2021: "Manual deployment took 3 days" (Impact: 8)
2022: "No one knew how to recreate server" (Impact: 9)
```

## **Demo 2: "The Magic File Creation" Live Demo**
**Time: During HCL Basics (Slide 12)**

### The Demo
Create a file on your local machine using Terraform in real-time, but make it interactive and fun.

### Terraform Code (Live Typing)
```hcl
# Create a personalized file for the audience
resource "local_file" "class_roster" {
  filename = "/tmp/terraform-class-${formatdate("YYYY-MM-DD", timestamp())}.txt"
  content  = <<-EOF
    🚀 Terraform Day 01 Class
    Date: ${formatdate("DD MMM YYYY", timestamp())}
    
    Students Present: ${var.student_count}
    
    Today we learned:
    ✅ Manual deployment is painful
    ✅ IaC solves real problems
    ✅ Terraform is declarative
    ✅ HCL is simple but powerful
    
    Next: Terraform commands & workflow!
    
    Generated by: Terraform 💪
  EOF
}

variable "student_count" {
  description = "Number of students in class"
  type        = number
  default     = 25
}

output "class_file_location" {
  value = local_file.class_roster.filename
}
```

### Live Execution
```bash
# Ask audience for student count
terraform plan -var="student_count=30"
terraform apply -auto-approve
cat /tmp/terraform-class-*.txt
```

## **Demo 3: "Provider Ecosystem Roulette"**
**Time: During Terraform Providers (Slide 9)**

### Interactive Game
Create a spinning wheel of Terraform providers and let audience guess what each one does.

### Providers to Include
- **Spotify** - Manage playlists as code
- **GitHub** - Repositories and teams
- **Random** - Generate passwords/UUIDs
- **Time** - Time-based resources
- **HTTP** - Make API calls
- **TLS** - Generate certificates

### Example: Spotify Provider Demo
```hcl
# Create a Terraform playlist!
resource "spotify_playlist" "terraform_class" {
  name        = "Terraform Learning Playlist"
  description = "Songs to code infrastructure to"
  public      = true

  tracks = [
    data.spotify_search_track.infrastructure.tracks[0].id,
    data.spotify_search_track.automation.tracks[0].id,
  ]
}

data "spotify_search_track" "infrastructure" {
  artist = "Kraftwerk"
  name   = "Computer World"
}
```

---

## **Demo 4: "Evolution Race" - Speed Comparison**
**Time: During Evolution of Infrastructure (Slide 3)**

### The Challenge
Show how long it takes to deploy the same infrastructure using different methods.

### Method 1: Manual (Simulated)
```bash
# Simulate manual deployment
echo "Step 1: Login to AWS Console... ⏰ 2 minutes"
sleep 2
echo "Step 2: Navigate to EC2... ⏰ 1 minute"
sleep 1
echo "Step 3: Choose AMI... ⏰ 3 minutes"
sleep 1
echo "Step 4: Configure instance... ⏰ 5 minutes"
sleep 1
echo "Step 5: Add tags... ⏰ 2 minutes"
sleep 1
echo "Step 6: Configure security group... ⏰ 4 minutes"
sleep 1
echo "Total time: 17 minutes (and prone to errors!)"
```

### Method 2: Terraform
```hcl
# Same infrastructure in code
resource "aws_instance" "demo" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1d0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  
  tags = {
    Name = "Demo Server"
  }
}
```

```bash
terraform apply -auto-approve
# Total time: 2 minutes (and repeatable!)
```

---

## **Demo 5: "State File Detective"**
**Time: During State Management (Slide 11)**

### The Mystery
Show how Terraform tracks resources by examining the state file like a detective.

### Setup
```hcl
resource "random_pet" "server_name" {
  length = 2
}

resource "local_file" "server_config" {
  filename = "/tmp/${random_pet.server_name.id}-config.txt"
  content  = "Server: ${random_pet.server_name.id}"
}
```

### Detective Work
```bash
# Apply the configuration
terraform apply -auto-approve

# Examine the evidence (state file)
terraform show
terraform state list
terraform state show random_pet.server_name

# The plot twist - what happens if we delete the file manually?
rm /tmp/*-config.txt

# Terraform knows something is wrong!
terraform plan
```

---

## **Demo 6: "Multi-Cloud Magic"**
**Time: During Why Terraform (Slide 8)**

### The Demo
Show Terraform managing resources across multiple providers simultaneously.

```hcl
# Local file (your machine)
resource "local_file" "readme" {
  filename = "/tmp/multi-cloud-demo.md"
  content  = "# Multi-Cloud Demo\nManaged by Terraform!"
}

# Random resource (HashiCorp Cloud)
resource "random_password" "api_key" {
  length  = 16
  special = true
}

# HTTP request (any API)
data "http" "my_ip" {
  url = "https://ipv4.icanhazip.com"
}

# Time resource (time-based)
resource "time_static" "deployment_time" {}

# Output everything
output "deployment_summary" {
  value = {
    file_created    = local_file.readme.filename
    api_key_length  = length(random_password.api_key.result)
    your_ip         = chomp(data.http.my_ip.response_body)
    deployed_at     = time_static.deployment_time.rfc3339
  }
}
```

## **Demo 7: "Terraform vs. Manual" Side-by-Side**
**Time: Throughout the lecture**

### Split Screen Demo
Show two terminals side by side:
- Left: Manual commands
- Right: Terraform equivalent

### Example Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Create a Directory Structure
```bash
# Manual (Left Terminal)
mkdir -p /tmp/manual-demo/app/{config,logs,data}
touch /tmp/manual-demo/app/config/app.conf
echo "port=8080" > /tmp/manual-demo/app/config/app.conf

# Terraform (Right Terminal)
resource "local_file" "app_structure" {
  for_each = toset([
    "/tmp/terraform-demo/app/config/app.conf",
    "/tmp/terraform-demo/app/logs/.gitkeep",
    "/tmp/terraform-demo/app/data/.gitkeep"
  ])
  
  filename = each.value
  content  = each.value == "/tmp/terraform-demo/app/config/app.conf" ? "port=8080" : ""
}
```

---

## **Demo 8: "The Idempotency Challenge"**
**Time: During Configuration Management (Slide 5)**

### The Challenge
Show what happens when you run the same operation multiple times.

### Manual Script (Breaks on Second Run)
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# manual-deploy.sh
mkdir /tmp/demo-app
echo "App deployed!" > /tmp/demo-app/status.txt
echo "Deployment complete!"

# Run it twice - second time fails!
```

### Terraform (Always Works)
```hcl
resource "local_file" "app_status" {
  filename = "/tmp/terraform-app/status.txt"
  content  = "App deployed at ${timestamp()}!"
}

# Run terraform apply multiple times - always works!
```

---

## **Demo 9: "Terraform Provider Surprise"**
**Time: End of lecture**

### The Surprise
Use an unexpected Terraform provider to create something fun.

```hcl
# Use the "cowsay" provider (if available) or create ASCII art
resource "local_file" "graduation_certificate" {
  filename = "/tmp/terraform-certificate.txt"
  content  = <<-EOF

## **Interactive Elements Throughout**

### 1. **Live Polls**
- "How many have used manual deployment?" (Show of hands)
- "Worst infrastructure disaster scale 1-10?" (Audience shouts numbers)
- "Guess this provider!" (Show provider logo, audience guesses)

### 2. **Code-Along Moments**
- Everyone creates their first `local_file` resource
- Live typing race: Who can type the resource block fastest?
- Spot the error: Show broken HCL, audience finds the issue

### 3. **Real-Time Feedback**
- Use a shared document where students can add questions
- Live state file examination with audience input
- Collaborative troubleshooting when demos "break"

### 4. **Gamification**
- Points for correct answers about providers
- "Terraform Bingo" with common terms
- Speed challenges for basic HCL syntax

---
